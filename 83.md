## Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
#### NO.83(츠바사)

Given a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appear only once.

***Example***:

```
Input: 1->1->2
Output: 1->2
```

***Example 2***:

```
Input: 1->1->2->3->3
Output: 1->2->3
```

Note:
1. You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
2. Minimize the total number of operations.

``` python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        now = head
        
        while now is not None and now.next is not None:
            if now.val == now.next.val:
                now.next = now.next.next
            else:
                now = now.next

        return head
```
