## Container With Most Water
### no.11

Given n non-negative integers a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub> , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, a<sub>i</sub>). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, a<sub>i</sub>) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

***Example 1***:

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

***Constraints***:
- 2 <= height.length <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>
- 2 <= height[i] <= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup>

## Two Pointer

``` python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        l, r = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_water = 0
        
        while l < r:
            distance = r - l
            current_water = min(height[l], height[r]) * distance
            max_water = max(current_water, max_water)
            
            if height[l] > height[r]:
                r -= 1
            else:
                l += 1
        
        return max_water
