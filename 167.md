## Two Sum 2 - Input array is sorted
#### No.167

Given an array of integers that is already  **_sorted in ascending order_**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note:**

-   Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
-   You may assume that each input would have  _exactly_  one solution and you may not use the  _same_  element twice.

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `2 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
-   `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
-   `nums` is sorted in  **increasing order**.
-   `-1000 <= target <= 1000`

``` python
def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
	for i in range(len(numbers)):
		num = target - numbers[i]
        left, right = i+1, len(numbers)-1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left+right)//2
                
            if numbers[mid] == num:
                return [i+1, mid+1]
            elif numbers[mid] > num:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
```
